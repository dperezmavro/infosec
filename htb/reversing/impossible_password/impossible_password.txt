this binary reads input twice, and the first check can be bypassed with SuperSeKretKey

further down you get at the next check where the function for comparing stuff looks super complex, so instead set a breakpoint at:
	breakpoint     keep y   0x0000000000400961

and then set rdi to be rsi (the complex generated value
	set $rdi=$rsi
and then continue to get the flag
