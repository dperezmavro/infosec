again I keep reading the goddamn assembly for too long before I try anything out. Regardless

opening this up in IDA, we see an interestingly named function: catflag

catflag is called in main, but to get to it you have to go through a crazy-ass loop and what I identified as a strlen check. 

in main we also see a reference to a weird looking string:
	.rodata:00000000004009A5 aDlr0wS1h7S1Yz4 db 'dlr0w_s1h7_s1_yz4rC',0

This is what gets strlen'd, and the result is compared to our own input's strlen a few blocks further down

I spent a while reading the assembly, only to realise that I should try to submit the string reversed:
	echo Cr4zy_1s_7h1s_w0rld | nc hack.bckdr.in 16016
this gives back a flag, whose sha256 we must submit
